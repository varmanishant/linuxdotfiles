VcXsrv
======

If you want to see Linux GUI on Windows, you can use start a VcXsrv server on
Windows and select "Disable access control" to allow access from anywhere.

In the Linux machine do: `export DISPLAY=<host.ip.address>` and start an X
application to see it in Windows. It is better to use the IP address of
Hyper-V's "Default Switch".

Since it uses TCP/IP which causes frequent disconnections, do the following
changes:

Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Power Options

HDD
    Turn off hard disk after: Never
Wireless Adapter Settings
    Power Saving Mode: Maximum Performance
Sleep
    Sleep after: Never
    System unattended sleep timeout: 0
    Hibernate after: Never

Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Connections

Properties > Configure > Power Management

Disable "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power".
