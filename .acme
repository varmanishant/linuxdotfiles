# Tips

1. Selecting brackets will select the content inside it. This can be useful for
   grouping commands. But it is a good idea to create a single command for
   commonly used functions.
2. The escape key (ESC) will select the content typed since last mouse action.
   If it is pressed again, it will cut the text. This is very handy in `win` to
   re-execute a command.
3. Fonts can be changed using the fontsrv command.
